	<li><p><strong style="color: brown;">Description of the project.: </strong> Establishing and maintaining moral barriers against committing criminal acts. Reducing recruitment to criminal social environments and
	activities by eliminating or reducing the social and individual causes and processes that lead to criminality. Developed a predictive model that accurately forecasts customer churn with 80% accuracy using machine learning.
	<ul>
<li>The project involves various key steps: First, collect historical crime data, clean and preprocess it, and perform feature engineering.Then, employ machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model for crime occurrences. Additionally, use geospatial tools to generate hotspot maps highlighting areas with higher crime rates.</li> 
<li>Collaborate with law enforcement and community organizations to develop preventive strategies and ensure ethical considerations, like data privacy and bias mitigation. tn this project explain me the technologies used to develop the project</p></li>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><p><strong style="color: brown;">Description of the project.: </strong>  With this implementation, we can simplify the process of building and deploying Maven based projects, making it more efficient and reliable. By automating these tasks, developers can focus on their code, knowing that the pipeline takes care of the build and deployment steps. This will ultimately save time, reduce errors, and improve overall project delivery.</li>
