    <p align="justify"><strong>Authors: </strong> Sabin TT (Assistant Professor), Archana R, Lithisha K J, Vikhyath P, Department of
Information Science and Engineering Students SJC Institute of Technology, Chikabalapura, India.<br><strong>Brief Abstract:</strong>  “Developed a novel Crime Prediction Model/Tool for Hotspot Mapping that
utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict crime patterns in urban areas.
Implemented advanced statistical techniques and geospatial analysis to identify high-risk areas and
potential crime hotspots based on historical crime data, demographic factors, and environmental
variables. The model demonstrated an accuracy rate of 85% in predicting crime occurrences,
enabling law enforcement agencies to proactively allocate resources and implement targeted crime
prevention strategies.”</p>
